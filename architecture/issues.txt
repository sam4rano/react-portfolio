1. Creating the useEffect gave me a lot of issues
as the way i created it according to the project i follow did'nt work
So i had to sort for how to deal with with it 
My way solution was 
After creating the useEffectuseEffect(() => {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      setLetterClass('text-animate-hover')
    }, 3000)
    return () => clearTimeout(timer)
  }, [])

  i created another variable to handle the timeout which was the primary issuesi faced
  at the start
  setTimeout was created to handle the timeout of the
  animation created while clearTimeout clear the timeout


  2. The second major issue i faced was when i was trying to change the map
  to my locaation  it was a bit of an issue
  but i later added the coordinates of my location and that save me of the setLetterClass


  3. The third issues was with using emailjs: the way it was stated in the tutorial didn' work for me
  so i have to create a variable to handle all the required filevendors
  templateId, serviceId and the publicToken and pass it as 
  a parameter to sendForm  that makes a lot of sense
